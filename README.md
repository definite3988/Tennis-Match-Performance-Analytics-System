# Tennis Match Performance Analytics System  

## Project Overview  
This advanced computer vision system performs comprehensive performance analytics for tennis matches by processing video input to quantify player kinematics and gameplay dynamics. The solution leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to track players, detect ball trajectories, and analyze court positioning with millimeter-level precision. Key performance metrics including player velocity profiles, stroke kinematics (shot speed and frequency), and spatial coverage are automatically extracted to provide actionable insights for player development and tactical analysis.

## Technical Implementation  

### Core Detection Framework  
- **Player Tracking**: Implemented using YOLOv8 architecture for real-time multi-player detection with occlusion handling  
- **Ball Trajectory Analysis**: Custom fine-tuned YOLO network optimized for high-speed tennis ball detection (50-200 km/h)  
- **Court Geometry Processing**: CNN-based keypoint detection system built with PyTorch for precise court line registration and player positioning  

### Performance Metrics Calculated  
1. **Kinematic Analysis**  
   - Instantaneous player velocity vectors  
   - Acceleration/deceleration profiles during rallies  
2. **Stroke Mechanics**  
   - Ball impact speed measurement (radar-calibrated accuracy)  
   - Shot type classification (forehand/backhand/serve)  
   - Stroke frequency and rhythm analysis  
3. **Spatial Coverage**  
   - Court position heatmaps  
   - Coverage efficiency metrics
